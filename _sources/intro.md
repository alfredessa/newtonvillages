This web site is intended as an information resource for Newton Village residents. Our mission is to ensure that major decisions which affect the villages' neigborhood and communities are made *transparently* and *consultatively*.

## Crafts Street Development Project

We are currently tracking a proposal by [Mark Development](https://www.markdevelopmentllc.com/) to build a major commercial Elder Housing with Services Facility in the Washington-Crafts-Court Street area. Facility construction requires major rezoning of lots from Multiresidence 1 and Manufacturing to Business 4. This would be the first Business 4 zone approval in Newton Village.

Although the project will substantially alter the neighborhood, it is on *fast-track approval* by the city of Newton's Department of Planning and Development. The lack of transparency and failure to perform basic due diligence is of grave concern to the community.
