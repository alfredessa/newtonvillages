# <font color="maroon">Process</font>

The decision-making process is utterly opaque and favors developers at the expense of neighborhoods and communities. As we find out more information, we intend to document:

- What is the timeline and stages for approval?

- What decisions will be made and when?

- Who are the decision makers?

- What criteria is used for the decisions?

- When is the community consulted?





Here is what we know thus far about the process. The following is the published timeline. It's not clear what will be decided at these meetings and whether they are open to the public (except for the first one):

- Public Hearing Date: May 17,2022
- Land Use Action Date: Aug 9, 2022
- City Council Action Date: Aug 15,2022
- 90-Day Expiration Date: Aug 15,2022
